A better manual coming soon?

It's been a little while, hasn't it?

Here are some new features, hot off the presses:
- Trail and robot colors actually save now!
- Multiplayer over the Internet works again, without port forwarding!
- New monster names! Pretty cool, right?
- You can now press F1 to go back to the menu without restarting the game.
- A built-in timer for speedrunning! Check your phone for more info.

Some other stuff changed too:
- Removed the long-broken Twitter integration (rest in piece, you will be missed...)
- Changed the location of custom maps from "whatever/Bundles" to "CustomMaps"

A mapping kit (for making cool custom maps) has been released, check it out:

An improved multiplayer experience is in the works, stay tuned...


Wow! Thanks for playing and thanks for reading!
